My First Repository

My name is Chris, and I am an American expat who is currently living on a farm in the Philippines. I spent most of my childhood in Upstate New York. I went to college in Syracuse, where my studies prepared me for law school and environmental policy work. I realized that I didn't want to become a lawyer once I graduated, so I moved to Baltimore and did public outreach and field surveying work for a few years. I eventually realized that what I was doing was having next to no positive impact on the real world, so I quit my jobs in 2013. 

I took a year off to travel across America on foot and by bicycle as I plotted a new direction for my career. The road took me across the Pacific to Taiwan, where I successfully made my first career change. I completed a training and taught English to children for a little over a year. After taking a break and traveling around Southeast Asia, I got back into teaching English as a second language via the internet. That is what I am currently doing for a living.

I won't be teaching English for the rest of my life, and that was never the plan in the first place. I made that career switch because I wanted to have a means to support myself while living abroad. I went overseas to get myself out of my comfort zone so that my mind could open itself to new opportunities. That's exactly what happened as I searched for ways to make money online and discovered how learning coding can help me generate extra income from anywhere in the world. 

Once I teach myself the basics of web development, my short term goals are to pick up freelance jobs and build an affiliate marketing website from scratch. I will still be teaching online as I work on these projects, so I also want to build a website with simple games for learning English that I can play with my students. After I make my planned return to the USA next spring, my longer term goals are to sharpen my skills, continue to build my portfolio through freelancing and pro bono work, and make contacts. I want all of this work to lead me to a stable job as a junior web developer by November 2018. 

My ultimate dream is to help build real world systems that help humans achieve ecological sustainability. I am confident that I will eventually do this if I can break into the tech industry and continue to learn coding and data analysis skills.
